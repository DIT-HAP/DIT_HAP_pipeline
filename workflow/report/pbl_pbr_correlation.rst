PBL-PBR Correlation Analysis
============================

This analysis examines the correlation between PBL (Primer Binding Left) and PBR (Primer Binding Right) read counts for transposon insertions.

**Analysis Overview:**

* **Correlation Coefficient**: Measures the linear relationship between PBL and PBR read counts
* **Scatter Plot**: Visualizes the relationship between paired read counts
* **Quality Assessment**: High correlation (>0.7) indicates good library quality

**Interpretation Guidelines:**

* **Strong Correlation (r > 0.8)**: Excellent library quality with balanced amplification
* **Moderate Correlation (0.5 < r < 0.8)**: Good library quality with some bias
* **Weak Correlation (r < 0.5)**: Poor library quality, potential technical issues

**Expected Results:**

* Well-prepared libraries should show strong positive correlation
* Outliers may indicate PCR bias or technical artifacts
* Consistent correlation across samples indicates robust protocol

This correlation analysis is crucial for validating the technical quality of transposon insertion libraries before downstream analysis.
