Comprehensive Quality Control Report
====================================

This report provides a complete overview of data quality assessment for the transposon insertion sequencing experiment, integrating multiple quality control analyses to ensure robust downstream analysis.

**Report Structure:**

**1. Preprocessing Quality (MultiQC)**
   - Raw data quality metrics
   - Adapter trimming efficiency
   - Demultiplexing accuracy
   - Overall sequencing quality

**2. Mapping Performance**
   - Alignment rates and statistics
   - Read pair integrity
   - Filtering effectiveness
   - Sample-level performance comparison

**3. Technical Quality Assessments**
   - PBL-PBR correlation analysis
   - Read count distribution patterns
   - Insertion orientation bias detection
   - Spatial density characterization

**Quality Control Workflow:**

1. **Data Preprocessing**: FastP trimming, demultiplexing, and initial QC
2. **Alignment Quality**: Mapping rates, pair statistics, and filtering
3. **Library Assessment**: PBL-PBR correlation and read distributions
4. **Insertion Analysis**: Orientation bias and density patterns
5. **Comprehensive Review**: Integrated quality metrics and recommendations

**Key Quality Metrics:**

* **Sequencing Quality**: >Q30 for most bases, minimal adapter contamination
* **Mapping Performance**: >80% alignment rate, >90% proper pairs
* **Library Quality**: High PBL-PBR correlation (r > 0.8)
* **Insertion Patterns**: Balanced orientation, appropriate density distribution

**Decision Framework:**

* **Green Status**: All metrics within acceptable ranges - proceed with analysis
* **Yellow Caution**: Some metrics borderline - consider additional QC
* **Red Alert**: Critical issues detected - investigate before proceeding

**Recommendations:**

Based on the integrated quality assessment:

* Samples meeting all quality thresholds are suitable for downstream analysis
* Samples with moderate issues may require additional filtering or normalization
* Samples with severe quality problems should be excluded or re-processed

**Usage Instructions:**

1. Review the MultiQC report for overall sequencing quality
2. Check mapping statistics for alignment performance
3. Examine correlation plots for library preparation quality
4. Assess distribution patterns for appropriate filtering thresholds
5. Evaluate insertion patterns for systematic biases

**Next Steps:**

After quality control validation:

* Proceed with statistical analysis of high-quality samples
* Apply appropriate filtering based on distribution analysis
* Consider batch correction if systematic differences are detected
* Document any quality-related exclusions for reproducibility

This comprehensive report ensures that only high-quality data proceeds to biological interpretation, maximizing the reliability and reproducibility of your transposon insertion sequencing results.
