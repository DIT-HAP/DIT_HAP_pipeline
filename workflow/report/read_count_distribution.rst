Read Count Distribution Analysis
=================================

This analysis characterizes the distribution of read counts across transposon insertions to assess library complexity and sequencing depth.

**Distribution Metrics:**

* **Histogram Plots**: Show the frequency distribution of read counts per insertion
* **Summary Statistics**: Mean, median, and standard deviation of read counts
* **Percentile Analysis**: Identify low and high-coverage insertions
* **Filtering Thresholds**: Evaluate the impact of minimum read count cutoffs

**Quality Indicators:**

* **Dynamic Range**: Wide distribution indicates good library complexity
* **Mode Position**: Should be above the noise threshold (typically >10 reads)
* **Tail Behavior**: Long tail suggests presence of highly expressed insertions
* **Zero Inflation**: Excessive zero counts may indicate poor library quality

**Expected Patterns:**

* **Healthy Libraries**: Log-normal distribution with clear separation from noise
* **Poor Libraries**: Narrow distribution concentrated near zero
* **Over-amplified Libraries**: Bimodal distribution with artificial peaks

**Analysis Components:**

* **Per-Sample Distributions**: Compare library quality across samples
* **Timepoint Comparisons**: Assess consistency across experimental conditions
* **Filtering Impact**: Evaluate how cutoffs affect data retention
* **Coverage Statistics**: Quantify sequencing depth adequacy

**Interpretation Guidelines:**

* Libraries with >80% insertions above the filtering threshold are considered high-quality
* Consistent distributions across replicates indicate reproducible library preparation
* Dramatic shifts between timepoints may reflect biological or technical effects

**Applications:**

* Set appropriate filtering thresholds for downstream analysis
* Identify samples requiring additional sequencing
* Assess the need for normalization strategies
* Validate experimental design assumptions

This analysis is crucial for optimizing data processing parameters and ensuring robust downstream statistical analysis.
