        "2. **Run All Cells**: Execute all cells in order to perform the complete analysis\n",
        "3. **Modify Parameters**: Adjust FDR thresholds and coverage thresholds as needed\n",
        "4. **Add/Remove Clusters**: Modify the `exclude_clusters` list to control which clusters are analyzed\n",
        "\n",
        "### Customization Options\n",
        "\n",
        "- **FDR Threshold**: Change `CONFIG['fdr_threshold']` to be more or less stringent\n",
        "- **Coverage Threshold**: Adjust `CONFIG['coverage_threshold']` for high-coverage filtering\n",
        "- **Visualization**: Modify the `create_enrichment_plot` function for different plot styles\n",
        "- **Export Format**: Add additional export formats in the results export section\n",
        "\n",
        "### Troubleshooting\n",
        "\n",
        "- **File Not Found**: Check that all paths in CONFIG point to existing files\n",
        "- **No Results**: Try relaxing the FDR threshold or checking gene ID format compatibility\n",
        "- **STRING API Issues**: The STRING API may be temporarily unavailable; results will be skipped automatically\n",
        "- **Memory Issues**: For large datasets, consider processing clusters individually\n",
        "\n",
        "### Output Files\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Excel File**: Contains all results in separate sheets for easy browsing\n",
        "- **CSV Files**: Individual CSV files for each enrichment method\n",
